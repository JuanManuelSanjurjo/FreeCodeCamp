        <h1 id="about"> About Cyberpunk 2077 </h1>
        <p>Cyberpunk 2077 is a highly anticipated video game developed by CD Projekt Red, the same studio behind the Witcher series. It is based on the Cyberpunk tabletop RPG franchise, which has a reputation for world-building and storytelling. The game is set in Night City, a dystopian society where humanity and technology are intertwined. The world is characterized by a discrepancy between advanced technology and the horrors of society, including financial inequality.
        </p>
        <p>The game is a continuation of the events in the Cyberpunk 2020 edition of the tabletop RPG franchise. It is not based on the controversial third edition of the franchise, Cyberpunk V3.0. However, the game may take some creative liberties that may not be reflected in subsequent Cyberpunk productions outside of the video game.</p>
        <p>One of the main draws of Cyberpunk 2077 is the level of customization available to players. Players can customize their character's appearance, background, and abilities, as well as their weapons and equipment. This customization allows players to tailor their experience to their preferred playstyle and to make their character truly their own.</p>
        <p>The game also features a variety of side missions and activities for players to engage with. These range from collecting iconic weapons and cars, to appeasing all of the game's fixers, to completing achievements and trophies. The game also features different endings based on the player's decisions throughout the game, encouraging players to replay the game multiple times to see all possible outcomes</p>
